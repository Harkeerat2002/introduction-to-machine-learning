# Introduction to Machine Learning Tasks

This workspace is organized into several directories, each containing resources and code for different tasks and tutorials. Here's a brief overview of each:

# IML-Demos
This directory contains demonstration code for various years (2020 to 2023). Each year's directory includes utilities and examples. Notably, the widgets.py file in each year's utilities directory defines a CLASSIFICATION_DATASETS variable. The 2020_demos/examples/utilities/load_data.py file includes a function circular_separable_data.

# IML-Python-Tutorial
This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for a basic Python tutorial (basic-python.ipynb), notebook tips and tricks (notebook-tips-and-tricks.ipynb), and a tutorial on NumPy (numpy.ipynb). There's also a pandas_and_plotting directory.

# Task Directories
There are several task directories, each named as Task X where X is the task number. Each task directory contains a main.ipynb Jupyter notebook, which also contains the task description. The task directory also contains a data directory, which contains the data for the task.
